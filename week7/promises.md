# Promise API

for asynchronous operations

- Promise class
  - Promise.resolve
  - Promise.reject
  - Promise.all

usage with:

## then-catch chain

or

## async-await structure

(includes normal try-catch)

Promise has two endstates:

- resolve (handled with then)
- reject (with catch)

And when the promise hasn't reach to the endstate yet, it is in pending state.

## perosonal notes
